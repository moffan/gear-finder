# gear-finder

## Notice! 

It does not do much of anything atm.

The ide of this project is to help new players and players like myself,
that find it hard to find the right items for my build. By helping you setting up your item searches in an easier way.

## How it will work (if everything goes as planed)

First you select a character you want to find gear for, then click on the item slot you want to search for.

Once a item slot is selected you can create a filter to search for. If you click on the + sign in front of a mod it will be added to your filter for that slot.

If your current item do not have to mod you are searching for, you can add it from a drop-down or enter it manually.

It will then procede to serach for items for that slot in your inventory and on the POE trade api, and notify you if a item is found.

### The notification

When a upgrade is found you will get a notification so that you can procede with the steps to accuire that item.

It is not the aim of this application to be a trade program or to compete with [poe.trade](http://poe.trade/) or [pathofexile.com/trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade) or any of the other sites allready out there.

But, if i can make it work, the notifiation will contain a link to one of these trade sites, with all your requierments allready filled out. So that you can see all the items that matches your filter, and from there contact the seller to buy the item.

### Disclamer

I do not have all that much time to work on this, so it might take a while to get to a working state. It will be done when its done :-P
